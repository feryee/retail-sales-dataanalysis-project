# retail-sales-dataanalysis-project
Beginner Data Analytics project using Excel and SQL to analyze retail sales data and extract business insights.

I worked on a retail sales data analytics project. I started with raw sales data, cleaned and organized it in Excel, and formatted it for analysis. I analyzed sales and profit trends and created a Profit_Status column to classify profit and loss. I also wrote SQL queries to calculate total sales, profit, and region-wise and category-wise performance. This project helped me understand how business data is analyzed step by step.
